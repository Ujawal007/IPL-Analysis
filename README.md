# IPL Analysis  

## Overview  
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches and ball-by-ball data from 2008 to 2020. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, we analyze trends, patterns, and insights related to team performances, player statistics, and match outcomes.  

The data analysis is performed on two datasets:  
- **IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020**  
- **IPL Matches 2008-2020**  

This project is ideal for cricket enthusiasts and data science practitioners looking to explore sports analytics.
